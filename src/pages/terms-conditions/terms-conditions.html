  <h1>General Terms of Service</h1>

  <p>
    These General Terms of Service (“General Terms”) are a legal agreement between you (“you,” “your”) and WhatsPay
    and/or Omegasoft Technology LLC (‘’WhatsPay,” “we,” “our” or “us”) and govern your use of WhatsPay services,
    including mobile applications, websites, software, hardware, and other products and services (collectively, the
    “Services”). If you are using the Services on behalf of a business, you represent to us that you have authority to
    bind that business or entity to these terms, and that business accepts these terms. By using any of the Services,
    you agree to these General Terms and any policies referenced within (“Policies”), including terms that limit our
    liability and require individual arbitration for any potential legal dispute. You also agree to any additional terms
    specific to Services you use (“Additional Terms”), such as those listed below, which become part of your agreement
    with us (collectively, the “Terms”). You should read all of our terms carefully.
  </p>

  <h2>1. WhatsPay Signup Registration</h2>

  <p>
    You must Sign up with us (a “WhatsPay Registration”) to use the Services. During registration we will ask you for
    information, which may include but is not limited to, your name and other personal information. You must provide
    accurate and complete information in response to our questions, and you must keep that information current. You are
    fully responsible for all activity that occurs under your WhatsPay Dashboard including available balances and
    Transfer transactions (Send & Request), including also for any actions taken by persons to whom you have granted
    access to the WhatsPay Service platform Application. We reserve the right to Approve, suspend or terminate the
    WhatsPay Activities of anyone who provides inaccurate, untrue, or incomplete information, or who fails to comply
    with WhatsPa’s Policy, terms and conditions.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Revisions, Disclosures and Notices</h2>

  <p>
    We may amend the Terms at any time with notice that we deem to be reasonable under the circumstances, by posting the
    revised version on our website or communicating it to you through the Services (each a “Revised Version”).
    You agree to WhatsPay’s E-Sign Consent. We may provide disclosures and notices required by law and other information
    about your WhatsPay transaction to you electronically, by posting it on our website, pushing notifications through
    the Services, or by emailing it to the email address listed in your WhatsPay Sign up. Electronic disclosures and
    notices have the same meaning and effect as if we had provided you with paper copies. Such disclosures and notices
    are considered received by you within twenty-four (24) hours of the time posted to our website, or within
    twenty-four (24) hours of the time emailed to you unless we receive notice that the email was not delivered. If you
    wish to withdraw your consent to receiving electronic communications, contact WhatsPay Support. If we are not able
    to support your request, you may need to terminate your WhatsPay Services.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Restrictions</h2>

  <p>
    You may not, nor may you permit any third party, directly or indirectly, to:
    1. export the Services, which may be subject to export restrictions imposed by US law, including US Export
    Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. Chapter VII); <br /><br />

    the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (31 C.F.R. Parts 500-599). Prohibited activity includes but is not
    limited to the provision of Services to or for the benefit of a jurisdiction, entity, or individual blocked or
    prohibited by relevant sanctions authorities, including but not limited to activities in Iran, Cuba, North Korea,
    Syria, or the Crimean Region of the Ukraine. If found to be in apparent violation of these restrictions, your
    account and WhatsPay Services could be terminated and your funds could be held for an indefinite period of time;
    <br /><br />
    3. access or monitor any material or information on any WhatsPay Platform using any manual process or robot, spider,

    exclusion headers on any Service, work around, bypass, or circumvent any of the technical limitations of the
    Services, use any tool to enable features or functionalities that are otherwise disabled in the Services, or
    decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer the Services; <br /><br />
    5. perform or attempt to perform any actions that would interfere with the proper working of the Services, prevent
    access to or use of the Services by our other customers, or impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load

    12. otherwise use the Services except as expressly allowed under these Terms.
    If we reasonably suspect that you have Transferred Money or requested Money from an illegal and unauthorized source
    [Money Laundering, Terrorist Organizations etc.] has been used for criminal purpose, you give us express
    authorization to share information about you, your WhatsPay Information, and any of your transactions with law
    enforcement.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Compatible Mobile Devices and Third-Party Carriers</h2>

  <p>
    We do not warrant that the Services will be compatible with your mobile device or carrier. Your use of the Services
    may be subject to the terms of your agreements with your mobile device manufacturer or your carrier. You may not use
    a modified device to use the Services if the modification is contrary to the manufacturer’s software or hardware
    guidelines, including disabling hardware or software controls—sometimes referred to as “jail broken.”
  </p>

  <h2>5. Intellectual Property Infringement</h2>

  <p>
    We respect the intellectual property rights of others and ask you to do the same. We have adopted an Intellectual
    Property Policy regarding third-party claims that your material infringes the rights of others. We respond to all
    valid notices of such infringement, and our policy is to suspend or terminate the services of repeat infringers.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>

  <p>
    We have implemented technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from
    accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that
    unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper
    purposes. You provide your personal information at your own risk. <br /><br />
    You are responsible for safeguarding your password and for restricting access to the Services from your compatible
    mobile devices and computer(s). You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or WhatsPay
    Account or any other breach of security. Notwithstanding, in the event of any dispute between two or more parties as
    to account ownership, we will be the sole arbiter of such dispute in our sole discretion. Our decision (which may
    include termination or suspension of any WhatsPay Services subject to dispute) will be final and binding on all
    parties.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Communications</h2>

  <p>
    You consent to accept and receive communications from us, including e-mail, text messages, calls, and push
    notifications to the cellular telephone number you provide to us when you sign-up with WhatsPay or update the
    contact information associated with your account. Such communications may include, but are not limited to requests
    for secondary authentication, receipts, reminders, notifications regarding updates to your account or account
    support, and marketing or promotional communications. You acknowledge that you are not required to consent to
    receive promotional texts or calls as a condition of using the Services. Call and text message communications may be
    generated by automatic telephone dialing systems. Standard message and data rates applied by your cell phone carrier
    may apply to the text messages we send you. <br /><br />
    You may opt-out of receiving promotional email communications we send to you by following the unsubscribe options on
    such emails. You may opt out of any promotional phone calls by informing the caller that you would not like to
    receive future promotional calls. You may only opt-out of text messages from WhatsPay by replying STOP. You
    acknowledge that opting out of receiving communications may impact your use of the Services.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Modification and Termination</h2>

    We may terminate these General Terms or any Additional Terms, or suspend or terminate your WhatsPay Account or your
    access to any Service, at any time for any reason. We may add or remove, suspend, stop, delete, discontinue or
    impose conditions on Services or any feature or aspect of a Service. We will take reasonable steps to notify you of
    termination or these other types of Service changes by email or at the next time you attempt to access your WhatsPay
    Account. You may also terminate the General Terms and Additional Terms applicable to your WhatsPay Account by
    deactivating your WhatsPay Account at any time.

  </p>

  <h2>16. Third Party Products</h2>

  <p>
    All third-party hardware and other products included or sold with the Services are provided solely according to the
    warranty and other terms specified by the manufacturer, who is solely responsible for service and support for its
    product. For service, support, or warranty assistance, you should contact the manufacturer directly. WHATSPAY MAKES
    NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO SUCH THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS, AND EXPRESSLY
    DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
  </p>

  <h2>17. Disputes</h2>

  <p>
    “Disputes” are defined as any claim, controversy, or dispute between you and WhatsPay, its processors, suppliers or
    licensors (or their respective affiliates, agents, directors or employees), including any claims relating in any way
    to these Terms or the Services, or any other aspect of our relationship.
  </p>

  <h2>18. Binding Individual Arbitration</h2>

  <p>
    You and WhatsPay agree to arbitrate any and all Disputes by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same
    individual damages and individual relief that a court can. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE GENERAL TERMS WILL ONLY BE ON
    AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER
    ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO
    PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST WHATSPAY. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found
    unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced
    (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration). All Disputes will be resolved finally and
    exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”) administered by the
    American Arbitration Association (https://www.adr.org) according to this Section and the applicable arbitration
    rules for that forum. The Arbitrator shall be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues,
    including issues relating to whether the General Terms and/or Additional Terms (or any aspect thereof) are
    enforceable, unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or
    estoppel. Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, you may elect to pursue your claim in your local
    small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as your matter remains in small claims court and proceeds
    only on an individual (non-class or non-representative) basis. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, fully
    applies. If you are a consumer bringing a claim relating to a transaction intended for a personal, household, or
    family use, any arbitration hearing will occur within the county where you reside. Otherwise, any arbitration
    hearing will occur in San Francisco, California, or another mutually agreeable location. The arbitrator’s award will
    be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. While an
    arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief, the Arbitrator may do so only with respect to the individual
    party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual party’s claim.
    An Arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon will not have a precedential or collateral estoppel effect. WhatsPay
    will reimburse the arbitration fees due to the American Arbitration Association for individual arbitrations brought
    in accordance with this section for all claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the Arbitrator determines that your
    claims were frivolous. If you prevail on any claim for which you are legally entitled to attorney’s fees, you may
    seek to recover those fees from the arbitrator. For any claim where you are seeking relief, we will not seek to have
    you pay our attorney’s fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the Arbitrator determines that your
    claim was frivolous. For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and WhatsPay also include
    respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized
    users or beneficiaries of the Services. Subject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above, you agree
    that any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions in consumer cases as discussed above) will be brought
    in and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state courts in the City and County of San
    Francisco, California, or federal court for the Northern District of California.
  </p>

  <h2>19. Governing Law</h2>

  <p>
    These General Terms and any Dispute will be governed by California law and/or applicable federal law (including the
    Federal Arbitration Act), without regard to its choice of law or conflicts of law principles.
  </p>

  <h2>20. Limitation on Time to Initiate a Dispute</h2>

  <p>
    Any action or proceeding by you relating to any Dispute must commence within one year after the cause of action
    accrues.
  </p>

  <h2>21. Assignment</h2>

  <p>
    These General Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you and
    any attempted transfer or assignment will be null and void.
  </p>

  <h2>22. Third Party Services and Links to Other Websites</h2>

  <p>
    You may be offered services, products and promotions provided by third parties and not by WhatsPay, including, but
    not limited to, third party developers who use WhatsPay’s services (“Third Party Services”). If you decide to use
    Third Party Services, you will be responsible for reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions for these
    services. We are not responsible or liable for the performance of any Third-Party Services. Further, you agree to
    resolve any disagreement between you and a third party regarding the terms and conditions of any Third-Party
    Services with that third party directly in accordance with the terms and conditions of that relationship, and not
    WhatsPay. The Services may contain links to third party websites. The inclusion of any website link does not imply
    an approval, endorsement, or recommendation by WhatsPay. Such third-party websites are not governed by these General
    Terms. You access any such website at your own risk. We expressly disclaim any liability for these websites. When
    you use a link to go from the Services to a third-party website, our Privacy Notice is no longer in effect. Your
    browsing and interaction on a third-party website, including those that have a link in the Services is subject to
    that website’s own terms, rules and policies.
  </p>

  <h2>23. Other Provisions</h2>

  <p>
    These General Terms, and any applicable Additional Terms or Policies, are a complete statement of the agreement
    between you and WhatsPay regarding the Services. In the event of a conflict between these General Terms and any
    other WhatsPay agreement or Policy, these General Terms will prevail and control the subject matter of such
    conflict. If any provision of these General Terms or any Additional Term is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, then it will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the
    greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
    These General Terms do not limit any rights that we may have under trade secret, copyright, patent, or other laws.
    No waiver of any term of these General Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other
    term.
